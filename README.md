# LIQUID DROP MODEL
Modern nuclear physics is a well-developed branch of physical science, with wide-ranging applications of its results in engineering and industry. At the same time, the development of a consistent theory of nuclei and nuclear processes presents certain problems. 

It is well known that the most important aim of nuclear physics is the study of nuclear structure and the explanation of properties on the basis of the interaction between nucleons which constitute nuclei. Difficulties of a modern theory of the nucleus are caused by both an insufficient knowledge of nuclear interactions and the multi particle character of nuclear systems.

Experimental data on nuclear interactions do not contradict the hypothesis of the pair character of nuclear forces. However, the absence of rigorous methods of calculations of many particle nuclear systems with strong interaction makes it necessary to use macroscopic nuclear models to describe particular nuclear properties. The development of nuclear models has led to considerable progress in the understanding of atomic nuclei. 

Nuclear models attempt to explain why certain combinations of protons and neutrons are stable while others show radioactivity. Liquid drop model is one of them. The theory underlying the model provides excellent estimates of average properties of nuclei.

## ATOMIC NUCLEUS
Atom contains a very small nucleus composed of positively charged protons and uncharged neutrons, surrounded by a much larger volume of space containing negatively charged electrons. The nucleus contains the majority of an atom’s mass because protons and neutrons are much heavier than electrons. Protons and neutrons, collectively called nucleons, are packed together tightly in a nucleus, With a radius of about 10−15 meters, a nucleus is quite small compared to the radius of the entire atom, which is about 10−10 meters. 

Elements are classified based on the number of protons nucleus contain. The number of neutrons in the nuclei of the same element may vary. The species that contain same number of protons but different number of neutrons are called isotopes. The chemical properties exhibited by an atom are determined by its electron cloud, which in turn is determined by the proton number. Therefore isotopes have identical nature but their masses varies. 

The nucleus is held together by the strong force, one of the four basic forces in nature. This force between the protons and neutrons overcomes the repulsive electrical force that would otherwise push the protons apart.

Nuclear properties are heavily influenced by both proton and neutron number. The stability of nucleus is determined by the combination of nucleons. So all isotopes of same element may not be stable. Unstable nuclei have a tendency to change their nuclear composition to attain stable nuclear configuration. The phenomena occur without any external simulation and are called radioactive decay.

## NUCLEAR STABILITY 
Several factors are to be taken to account while discussing stability of nucleus 
-  Neutron-proton ratio 
-  Atomic mass
-  Even or odd number protons and neutrons 
-  Binding energy per nucleon 

Lighter nuclei tend to have same number of neutrons and protons. As atomic number increases, more number of neutrons are required to stabilize nucleus since coulomb repulsion between protons also increases. Thus heavier atoms tend to have higher neutron-proton ratio. 

Nuclei also tend to unstable at higher masses, as strong nuclear force is extremely short ranged and is unable to hold together the neutrons and protons required to for a stable atoms. 

Nucleus tends to more stable if they contain even numbers of protons and neutrons. Odd-even pair and even-odd pair are less stable. Only five known stable nuclei contain odd-odd pair of neutrons and protons. This is one unpaired nucleon, while in odd-odd nuclei there are two. This will decrease their stability. 

Binding energy is defined as the energy released while a nucleus is formed from its constituent nucleons. This is equal to the energy required to separate the nucleons into nucleons. The decrease in energy is reflected in the mass of nuclei which is always less than sum of mass of all the protons and neutrons it contains. The difference is termed as mass defect. The binding energy is equal to the energy equivalent to mass defect as defined by the mass-energy equivalence. The nucleus is more stable when the binding energy per nucleon is higher.

## LIQUID DROP MODEL
The liquid drop model was proposed by George Gamov in 1929. Nucleons were assumed to be interacting with only neighbouring nucleons. If they were fixed in their position like atoms in a solid, there would have been vibrations, and it was calculated that atom would not be stable. So nucleons were said to be free to move around in the nucleus like molecules in a liquid. The binding energy was then equal to the energy released from the interactions between nucleons. In this way, five types of interaction energies were calculated.

### Volume energy 
In range of around 1 fm, nuclear forces are attractive. Thus when two nucleons interact through strong nuclear force, a net release in energy is resulted.

If U is the total energy released due to such a binding of two nucleons, it can thought of as each nucleons releasing ½U equivalent of energy. Since strong force does not differentiate between protons and neutrons, interactions between different types of nucleon does not result in release in different energies. 

Both nucleons and the nucleus are then approximated as spherical in shape. A sphere can have a maximum of twelve neighbours. Therefore a single nucleon releases a total energy 6U from interacting with the twelve neighbouring nucleons. So in a closely packed nucleus having A number of nucleons, where A is the mass number of the nucleus, the total energy released is 6UA.

Thus the energy released from interaction of nucleons is directly proportional to the mass number of nucleons. This is called the volume energy, since it is proportional to the volume.

  <b>𝐸<sub>𝑉</sub>=𝑎<sub>1</sub>𝐴</b>
 </p>
Where a1 is a constant.

### Surface energy
Since nucleus behaves as drop of liquid, it exhibits characteristics like surface tension. Presence of surface tension can increase the net energy of the drop. In a nucleus, the identical energy term is called surface energy.
While calculating volume energy term, it was assumed that all the atoms have twelve neighbours. This is false in the case of surface nucleons, thus the net energy released is less than the volume energy. Surface energy is proportional to surface area, which is proportional to square of radius of nucleus. Since volume is directly proportional to mass number and to the cube of radius, a proportionality relation can be worked out between mass number and surface energy. Thus surface energy term is found out to be,
<p align="center">
 <b>𝐸<sub>S</sub>=-𝑎<sub>1</sub>𝐴<sup>2/3</sup></b>
 </p>
Where a2 is a constant and negative sign indicates that surface energy decreases the binding energy.

### Coulomb energy
Since protons are positively charged there is no coulomb repulsion between them. If A is the mass number, i.e. there are Z protons, then the total number of interactions are Z (Z-1). Thus resultant potential energy is given by,
<p align="center">

</p>
Where [1𝑟] is the average of inverse of distance between two nucleons in the nucleus and is proportional to radius of nucleus. Therefore,

𝐸𝐶=−𝑎3𝑍(𝑍−1)𝐴13
If two atoms have same mass number but one has more neutrons then coulomb energy term is less negative as average radius increase. Thus for heavier atoms increase in number of neutron for stabilizing the nucleus.

### Asymmetry energy
Although more neutrons can reduce coulomb repulsion, the increase in difference between neutron and proton can decrease the total binding energy. This occurs since protons and neutron are arranged in energy levels separately. Thus if all the nucleons in an atom are protons or neutrons only, the nucleons will reach higher energy levels as compared to an atom with same mass number and equal number of protons and neutrons.

The energy due to the difference in energy can be calculated as 𝐸𝑎=−𝑎4(𝐴−2𝑍)2𝐴

### Pairing energy
In the nucleus proton-proton and neutron-neutron pair tend to occur, which release energy and thus stabilize the atom. Therefore atoms with even number of protons and even number of neutrons are most stable with no unpaired nucleon.

If atom has odd-odd or even-odd neutron and proton, then there is one unpaired nucleon, and it is less stable.
Odd-odd nuclei are the least stable with two unpaired nucleons. In fact five odd-odd nuclei are known to be stable.
Pairing energy term is given by, 𝐸𝑃=(±,0)𝑎5𝐴𝑘
Coefficient is 0 for odd-even and even-odd nuclei, positive for even-even and negative for odd-odd nuclei.
Thus the total binding energy is given by,
𝐸=𝑎1𝐴−𝑎2𝐴23−𝑎3𝑧(𝑧−1)𝐴13−𝑎4(𝐴−2𝑍)2𝐴(±,0)𝑎5𝐴𝑘
